# Pewlett_Hackard

## Overview
Pewlett Hackard is looking to offer a retirement package to certain individuals that meet the criteria, as well as thinking about which positions will need to be filled in the near future. In order to not leave thousands of vacant positions, Bobby, an up-and-coming HR analyst, and us must find some answers. We need to find who will be retiring soon and how many positions will be left open. Using SQL and six CSV files provided by Pewlett Hackard, we had to perform an analysis of the employees to find the answers to these questions. 

## Results
Our analysis of the individuals eligible to retire found that:
- There are a total of 90,398 employees who are eligible to retire, meaning that we must soon find candidates to fill those roles. 
- Of those 90,398 employees, 50,842 are senior employees (Senior Engineer and Senior Staff), 9,285 are Engineers, 7,636 are Staff, 3,603 are Technique Leaders, 1,090 are Assistant Engineers, and two are Managers.

Our analysis of the individuals eligible for the mentorship program found that:
- There are a total of 1,549 employees available for the mentorship program.
- Of those 1,549 employees, 569 are Senior Staff, 501 are Engineers, 169 are Senior Engineers, 155 are Staff, 78 are Assistant Engineers, 77 are Technique Leaders, and none are managers. 

## Summary
As the "Silver Tsunami" begins to make an impact, almost 100,000 roles will need to be filled. Of the 90,398 retiring employees and 1,549 employees available for the mentorship program. This would mean that each of the employees eligible to mentor would have to train approximately 58 new employees. If this is doable in their last year(s) of employement, then it is possible to have the eligible employees train the next generation. However, we and Bobby feel that unless an extraordinary time period lies between the mentor and retirement, that it is not possible, and Pewlett Hackard would need to outsource training or find another method to prepare the next generation.

Depending on the criteria for being a mentor, a query that would find the total number of employees (retiring and not retiring) that are eligible to train would be extremely beneficial given the large number of positions that will become vacant. 

In addition, a query that counted the number of individuals in each position that were eligible to be a mentor would be beneficial as well.
